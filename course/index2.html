    <h1>Biostatistics - A living course!</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, biostatistics is hard for people who do not like math. Especially for people working on
      health, biostatistics seems like an awful puzzle game. My purpose is to softly teach the basic biostatistics
      concepts such as population, sample, sampling, probability distributions, hypothesis tests, and so
      forth by using simple information technology resources so that the learning is maximized.
    </p>
    

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      This course is towards all people who want to learn biostatistics such as doctors, physicstherapeutics,
      psichologists, nutritionists, biologystis, scientists, and anyone who desire to aquire this kind of
      knowledgement. The majority of the biostatistics courses have been teaching by using boring resources
      and/or hard language. My course is based on experimental biostatistics thanks the computational simulation
      that creates clever online trials where the student can assessment herself or himself. The virtual laboratory is
      compunded by a lot of virtual experiments. Although, each experiment reflects the reality because it was
      developed by randomness. All classes are watched by any personal computer, cell phone, lap-top, and so forth.

    <p>
      Samples will show you how the course and the technological resources will improve your learning.
      The computational simulation tools are essential didactic methods capable of improving your
      learning experience during the classes. You will improve your biostatistics skills by using our
      simulators. Try <a href="samples.html">here!</a>
